# Classifying Twitter Feeds

This project, in partnership with the ONS, aims to develop a methodology to classify Twitter feed data into tweets by bots, business and individuals. The intention is to understand more of the discussions ongoing between the personal accounts of people, without the noise of actors with alternative agendas.

### Prerequisites

To get started on the data_collection you will need to apply for a Twitter developer account and get your keys. You will also need the following packages:
```
pip install GetOldTweets3
pip install tweepy
```

### Features

The code for the features are across several notebooks as we siloed areas to each of the team. 

### Models

The bot detection model should be ran first as we filter these our for the business model.

### Analysis

Some good examples of the three classes, sentiment and network analysis.
