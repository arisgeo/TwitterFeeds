# Classifying Twitter Feeds

In partnership with the Office for National Statistics (UK), this project aims to classify live Twitter feeds into bots, organisations and real users.

### Prerequisites

To get started on the data_collection you will need to apply for a Twitter developer account and get your keys. You will also need the following packages:

```
pip install GetOldTweets3
pip install tweepy
```

### Features

The code for the features are across several notebooks as we siloed feature engineering across the team. 

### Models

We recommend running the bot detection model first, the business model filters these out first!

### Analysis

Some useful examples of the three classes, sentiment and network analysis.

### Authors

See the list of [contributors](https://github.com/arisgeo/TwitterFeeds/contributors) who participated in this project.
